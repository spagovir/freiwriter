A text editor to aid in freewriting. 

Freewriting is the brainstorming practice of writing continuously without editing for a fixed amount of time. This editor contains the following features to aid in that practice:
- The cursor cannot be moved from the end of the text: The editor does not allow going back to a previous point to edit or backspacing to delete what has been written.
- The editor alerts the writer if he or she makes a long enough pause in writing.
- The editor contains a timer for the freewriting period.
